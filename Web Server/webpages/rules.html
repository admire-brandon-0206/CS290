            For those uninitiated, Magic: The Gathering is a trading card game that has been around for over 25 years.
            It is
            complex, and there are tens of thousands of cards. The cards come out in sets of about 250 a couple times a
            year. There are some cards that are reprinted, but every year 100s of unique cards are added to the pool.
            How do
            you decide which cards to play? Formats are the answer. Oftentimes arbitrary, formats limit the field of
            cards
            availible to be put into decks. Those limitations cause each format to have its own identity, flavor, and
            problems.

            Century Commander is an attempt to solve some of those problems, while still keeping things interesting. It
            is
            aimed to try and keep the cost of the cards themselves approachable to everyone, while maintaining a
            competetive
            and fun environment.
