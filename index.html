    <h1 class="mainheader">Welcome!</h1>

    <p class="bodytext">
        Welcome to century commander! This is a format that I dreamt up after seeing the stupid prices that most magic
        cards are, and not having anyone to play with because of it. Century Commander aims to bring the cost down for
        kitchen table style Magic: The Gathering, while simultaneously keeping it competitive, while also trying to make
        it so the person with the biggest wallet doesn't win by default.

    <p class="bodytext">
        The <a href="rules.html">Rules</a> page has more information on what the format is, as well as the deck building
        restrictions. The
        <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> page has a list of upcoming events, and the <a href="about.html">About</a>
        page has my contact info, as well as
        the general community info.
